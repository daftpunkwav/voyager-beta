/*
 * integration_assets.h — Verified access to the shipped integration templates.
 *
 * The binary used to embed every integration artifact it installs — nine
 * complete shebang'd shell scripts, their PowerShell/.cmd twins, and the
 * generated JS/TS client modules — as C string literals, written to client
 * config dirs at 0755. That block of script-shaped bytes inside an unsigned
 * executable overlaps script-bearing installer/launcher feature families used
 * by static malware classifiers. That does not identify the cause of any
 * opaque vendor verdict. The unnecessary bodies now live in ONE independently
 * inspectable data file, assets/engine-integrations.json,
 * and the binary embeds exactly ONE constant about them: the file's SHA-256
 * (generated at build time into engine_integrations_hash.h).
 *
 * Integrity model: every use verifies the file against that constant first.
 * This preserves the tamper-evidence the templates had while compiled in;
 * a verified copy is bit-identical to the shipped one by construction, so
 * WHICH copy satisfied the check never matters — only availability does.
 *
 * Resolution order: $ENGINE_ASSETS_DIR (authoritative when set — a bad explicit
 * override fails, it never falls back), else next to the running binary (the
 * flat release-archive layout install.sh/install.ps1 execute from), else the
 * source-tree layout <bindir>/../../assets (build/c/ builds and test-runner),
 * else the stored copy under <home>/.engine/assets/<sha256>/.
 *
 * The stored copy is the OWNERSHIP REFERENCE: `install` persists the verified
 * bytes to <home>/.engine/assets/<sha256>/ — a SIBLING of the disposable cache
 * (~/.cache/graph-engine), never inside it — so uninstall can decide
 * "is this deployed file ours?" by materializing templates from it long after
 * the release archive is gone. Deciding ownership by materialize-and-compare
 * against these templates REPLACES the old exact-match against embedded
 * literals; released[] carries the historical bodies older versions wrote, so
 * upgrades and uninstalls keep recognising them. Content addressing prevents
 * same-version rebuilds from overwriting another build's ownership reference.
 * Foreign or user-modified
 * files are preserved exactly as before.
 *
 * Single-threaded by design: only the CLI install/uninstall paths touch this,
 * never the MCP server or hook-augment hot paths.
